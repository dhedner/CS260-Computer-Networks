# CS260 Computer Networks

## Description
Various projects that exercise network technologies and protocols, specifically in writing portable socket-based software.

## Individual Projects
* Assignment 1 - Simple UDP client that sends data to a remote server, waits for a packet in response, and prints the contents of the packet to the standard output.
* Assignment 2 - Non-blocking TCP client in which the update loop periodically waits for a delayed response from the remote server.
* Assignment 3 - HTTP proxy server that receives HTTP requests for other servers, pass the request to the correct system, and forward the response on to the original requester.
* Assignment 4 - Incorperate socket code into an existing game prototype that is built with lockstep replication, allowing for multiplayer network play.
